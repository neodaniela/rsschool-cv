## **About me**
> *IT specialist not only by position, but also by vocation.*

**Skillfull QA engineer.** An innate love for structures and graphs helps me to easily see the whole picture of testing and its components. The magic of test automation absolutely delights me.

**Novice front-end developer.** I like quality control, but I also keen on creating something new. Recently, I have been learning front-end development on my own, so I hope to one day become a full-fledged developer.

I love to work in a team, I always try to help my neighbor, I take responsibility for onboarding newbies.

However, it is impossible to tell about everything in a nutshell.

**In IT we trust!**
